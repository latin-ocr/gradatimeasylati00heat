(b) A Sentence containing a Relative word is often
called an Adjectival Clause, because it qualifies a
Substantive like an AdJective.

I have α black table.

A Relative Clause may be omitted without altering the
construction of any other word in the sentence.

(c) A Relative word is often omitted in English
but never in Latin.

Wliere z's the table I saw yescerclay ?
Ubi est ea mensa, quam heri vidi 2

(d) The Relative always comes first in its own
Clause (except after Prepositions), and generally next
to the word it qualifies.

Relative words are—

Qui, qualis, quantus,
Quo, qua, unde, ubi.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE.
