AD-IECTIVES.

§m An ADJECTIVE (or NOUN ADJECTIVE) is a
word added to a Substantive to distinguish it from
others like it.

In English, Adjectives have only one form.

In Latin, many Adjectives have three Terminations
in each Case, one for each of the three Genders,
Masculine‚ Feminine‚ and Neuter.

POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS, which are really Adjectives, agree

in Latin with the Thinq Possesaed, and are not affected as in
Enylish by the gender of the Possessor.

Taurus vulneravit suam dominam.
Tite hall wozmded his mistress.
