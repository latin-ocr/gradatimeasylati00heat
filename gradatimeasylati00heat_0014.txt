DECLENSION.

ξ 1. SUBSTANTIVES (or NOUNs SUBSTANTIVE) are
the AVccmes of Things.

In English we say—

The wasp killed the fly.
The boy killed the wasp.

In each of the sentences the word “ wasp” is unchanged,
though in one the wasp cloes the action, in the other
the wasp suffers the acti0n3 the order only has been
altered.

In Latin this difference is expressed not by albering.
the order, but by changes in the form of the word,

called Case-Endings.

Nominative Vespc‘l, lwhen the wasp does the action.

Accusative Vespam, when the wasp suffers the action.

Vespa muscam necavit. The ωιτη) killed the fly.
Vespam puer necavit. The boy killed elce wasp.

Pronouns are the only words in English which have differ-
ent forms for N ominative and Aceusative.

Nom, I ; who.
Acc. Me3 whom.
