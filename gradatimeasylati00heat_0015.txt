ξ 2. Besides the Nominative and Aoousative,
Latin has three other Cases,

Gnmrwn, DATIVE, Anmrwn,

the meaning of which is expressed 111, English by
Prepositions‚ of, to, by, eto.

Genitive Vespzirum, of wasps.
Dative Vespae, to the wasp.
Ablative Vespa, by the wasp.

English has also a special ease-ending (⁷s) sor the Genitive.

The wasp’s sting ; or
The sting of the wasp.

ξ 3. There are thus in Latin five Cases in the
Singular‚ each With its own Ending, and the same
number in the Plural.

There is also another Case, the Vocathre, used of the Person
Addressed‚ but it has always the same form as the N ominative,
except in Nouns in -us of Declension II.

To give these changes in the form of a Substantive

is called Declim‘ny a Substantive.

CONJUGATION.

ξ 4. VERBS express Aetions.
Aotions are done by different Persons: we express
this differenoe in Enylz‘sh by placing Pronouns before the

Verb, sometimes (but not often) altering its form also.
I love, you love, he (or she) loves.

In Latin there is a special form for each Person, both

in the Singular and the PluraL therefore the Pronoun

need not be put in.
Amo, amas, amat.
All Substantives are of the Third Person3 if, therefore,

Substantive is used, the Verb will be in the Third Person.
Wasps sting.
